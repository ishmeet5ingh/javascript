# new keyword

- Resbonsible for using the functional way of creating object

- For invoking the constructor and creating new instance every single time no matter how many time u use the new keyword new copy of function object is created

- Also take care of this keyword

- Look image 03 -> if we don't use new keyword at line 9 then 'this' in the constructor function points to the window object and in node pointing to nothing that is why its saying undefined

- When there is new keyword  'this' point to the constructor function.

- In JavaScript, the new keyword is used to create instances of objects from constructor functions. When you use 'new' before a function call, it transforms the function into a constructor.
